[Getting a user's physical location]
Geolocation API

Geolocation API call takes approx. 3~4 seconds.
However, the return statement will render the JSX code immediately after the call.
There is no way to wait until we get the coordinates back before we render the coords in the div.

So we're going to use the state of the component to wait.
In order to do this, we need to change our App component to a class component (currently a functional component)

Inherit React.Component using extends (like in Java)
