[Component Lifecycle Methods]
constructor - Good place to do one-time setup
render (not optional) - Avoid doing anything besides returning JSX
content becomes visible on screen
componentDidMount - Good place to do data-loading
sit and wait for updates
componentDidUpdate - Good place to do more data-loading when state/props change
sit and wait until this componenet is no longer shown
componentWillUnmount - Good place to do cleanup (especially for non-React stuff)
