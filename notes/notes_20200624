[Rules of State]
Only usable with class components
    Technically can be used with functional components using the 'hooks' system (something that will be discussed later)
    But the hooks system is more complicated than the state system
Easily confused with props
'State' is a JS object that contains data relevant to a component
Updating 'state' on a component causes the component to (almost) instantly rerender
State must be initialized when a component is created
**State can only be updated using the function 'setState'


the key reason behind using state in this 'season' project would be that updating a state on a component will cause it to rerender
and we need that becuase state will be updated once we get a return latitude value from calling the API
